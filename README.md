# Library of Lijun Zhu's Publication
## Purpose
This is a reporsitory that collects all pubication I (Lijun Zhu) had since 2015.
I intended to use it as submodule to build other repos such as resume and personal website.
It will also be included in my personal library of referenced papers.

## A List of Publications
Below is a list of my publication ordered by published dates taken from Google Scholar (APA):

## Usage
This section discuss common usage of this repository.

### Use as a submodule for other repos
A list of perosnal publication is usually a part of one's resume, CV, or website.
For the sake of consistancy, they should be the same (or at least contains the same information with different formats).
What will be better than them sharing the same source file?
This repo can easilly be included as a submodule for other project.
Next time when I am update my resume or rebuild my personal website, all I need to do is to update the info in this single repo.
The rest repos can be updated by pulling the upstream. This helps simplify the steps of adding more publications and ensure consistancy between different forms.

### Use as a source for quike email copy & paste
Many times, I want to send a portion of my publications to my collaborators through email.
A complete library in .bib file seems to be a overkill.
Moreover, it is not always easy for them to read bib files many of whom are more familiar with GUI in Windows.
Thus, it comes in handy to have this list of publication as source of copy & paste for those quick emails.
